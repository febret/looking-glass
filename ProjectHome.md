Looking Glass is a hydrographic visualization application, developed to analyze data coming from the ENDURANCE project exploration of ice-covered Lake Bonney, Antarctica.

NASA's Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP) Program is supporting ENDURANCE - the Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-ice Robotic ANtarctic Explorer - to demonstrate concepts for exploring the ice-covered ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa. ENDURANCE is designed to swim untethered under ice, in order to create three-dimensional maps of the underwater environment, and to collect data and samples of microbial life.
ENDURANCE goals are to:
  * further biological re­search in the ter­res­trial en­vi­ron­ments analo­gous to those found on other planets,
  * develop tech­nologies that enable remote searches for, and identification of, life in extreme environments
  * perform a systems - level field campaign designed to demon­strate and vali­date the science and tech­nology in extreme environ­ments on Earth. (Astro­biology Science and Tech­nology for Ex­ploring the Planets) Program.
